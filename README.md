# What is Musicso?
Short about Musicso. Musicso is a hobbyist project that is made by one person. It has most
basic features that will be described below. Musicso doesn't have any fantasy design it's just 
build on C# and .NET Framework in WPF Application. Musicso will be developed till I run out of 
ideas what to add or improve. I will appreciate any Feedback for Musicso. If Musicso somehow 
blows up then I will be treating Musicso like Full-Time project, and maybe will develop mobile
versions in the future. For now it's just a hobbyist project and will be developed for a short ammount 
of time (I want to finish it by the end of August 2024).
